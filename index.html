  <p align="justify">I'm a Computer Science PhD researcher at the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank">University of Cape Town</a>. I explore the integration
  of data-based (e.g. machine learning) and knowledge-based (e.g. ontologies) AI in an intelligent agent for health monitoring using sensors. My research
  is conducted within the <a href="https://airu.org.za/" target="blank">Artificial Intelligence Research Unit (AIRU)</a>, which hosts South Africa's <a href="https://www.cair.org.za/" target="blank">
  Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR)</a> network.
  I'm supervised by Prof. Deshen Moodley, and I am a <a href="https://hpi.de/en/research/cooperations-partners/research-schools/university-of-cape-town.html" target="blank">
  Hasso Plattner Institute Fellow</a>, <a href="https://mawazoinstitute.org/fellowship" target="blank">Mawazo Fellow</a>, and recipient of the <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/generation-google-scholarship-emea">
  Generation Google Scholarship</a>.</p>
  <p align="justify">Prior to this, I graduated with Distinction from the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a>, where I
  earned an MSc in Advanced Computer Science with a specialization in AI. I did my dissertation in deep learning and human-robot interaction at the
  <a href="https://corolab.github.io/" target="_blank">Cognitive Robotics Lab</a>, supervised by Prof. Angelo Cangelosi. I was a
  <a href="https://www.chevening.org/" target="_blank">Chevening Scholar</a>, funded by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.</p>
  <p align="justify">I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I spent the first few years of my career working as a software engineer, and also had a brief stint in
  technology consulting. I enjoy speaking, presenting, and writing about technology, as well as mentorship and outreach in the field. I am currently mentoring
  Computer Science undergraduate students as part of the <a href="https://www.kamilimu.org/" target="_blank">KamiLimu</a> mentorship program. I have been a contributing
  technical writer at <a href="https://scotch.io/@mbithenzomo" target="_blank">Scotch.io</a> and <a href="https://realpython.com/team/mnzomo/" target="_blank">RealPython.com</a>,
  where I have written programming tutorials on Python and its web frameworks. I have also been active with <a href="https://djangogirls.org/" target="_blank">Django Girls</a>,
  and have volunteered as a coach for workshops in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Manchester.</p>
  <p align="justify">On a weekend, you can probably find me hiking one of <a href="https://insideguide.co.za/cape-town/hiking-trails/" target="blank">Cape Town's beautiful trails </a>
  (Platteklip Gorge and Little Lion's Head are firm favourites!) or road tripping across the Western Cape and beyond... but I am equally happy curled up on the couch with a good audiobook or podcast.
  You can reach me by email at [my_first_name] . [my_last_name] @ gmail . com.</p>
