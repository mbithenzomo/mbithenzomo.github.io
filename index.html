          <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
      </div>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science PhD researcher at the <a href="http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/research/hpi/" target="_blank">Hasso Plattner Institute
      Research School at the University of Cape Town</a>, funded by the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering. I am broadly interested in
      Artificial Intelligence for Development (AI4D), with my research focus being agent-based computing and machine learning for healthcare in Africa.
      My research is conducted within the <a href="https://www.cair.za.net/group/1" target="_blank">Adaptive and Cognitive Systems Lab</a>, part of South
      Africa's Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) network. I'm supervised by Prof. Deshen Moodley.</p>
      <p>Prior to this, I graduated with Distinction from the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a>, where I
      earned an MSc in Advanced Computer Science with a specialization in AI. I did my dissertation in deep learning and human-robot interaction at the
      <a href="https://corolab.github.io/" target="_blank">Cognitive Robotics Lab</a>, supervised by Prof. Angelo Cangelosi. I was a
      <a href="https://www.chevening.org/" target="_blank">Chevening Scholar</a>, funded by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I spent the first few years of my career working as a software engineer, and also had a brief stint in
      technology consulting. I enjoy speaking, presenting, and writing about technology, as well as mentorship and outreach in the field. I am currently mentoring
      Computer Science undergraduate students as part of the <a href="https://www.kamilimu.org/" target="_blank">KamiLimu</a> mentorship program. I have been a contributing technical
      writer at Scotch.io and RealPython.com, where I have written programming tutorials on Python and its web frameworks. I have also been active with
      <a href="https://djangogirls.org/" target="_blank">Django Girls</a>, and have volunteered as a coach for workshops in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Manchester.</p>
